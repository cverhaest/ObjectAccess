# Object Access for Salesforce

In some scenario's it's useful to be able to have an easy overview of the number of custom objects a user has access to.

This Lightning Component provides a lightweight, read-only, easy-to-use report of that number of custom objects.

The number of objects takes into account the additional permission sets that are assigned to the user.

Objects access to namespaced objects is not taken into account.
